// This file will work once Convex is initialized with `npx convex dev`
// For now, it's a placeholder that won't break the build

// The actual implementation will be generated when Convex runs
// Uncomment and use once Convex is set up:
/*
import { query } from "./_generated/server";

export const currentUser = query(async (ctx) => {
  // This will be implemented once we have user storage in Convex
  // For now, return null - this can be extended based on your needs
  return null;
});
